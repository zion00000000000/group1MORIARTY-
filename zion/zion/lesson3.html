                    <p>What I've learned about media information literacy from Sir Lee Mar Sabugar's third lesson. I've learned that information literacy within a media context can be incredibly insightful for us students. It allows us to develop crucial skills to navigate the vast sea of information available today. Reflecting on this lesson, it's remarkable how crucial it is for individuals to learn how to critically assess sources, recognize biases, and discern credible information from the vast amount of content available. It encourages us students to question information, teaching them not to take everything at face value. It's about empowering us to be active participants in their media consumption, fostering a sense of responsibility in verifying the accuracy of what they encounter online or in traditional media. The ability to fact-check, recognize reliable sources, and understand the nuances of bias in media content is a valuable skill set applicable not only in academic pursuits but also in everyday life. Moreover, by providing practical exercises and case studies, this lesson likely prompts students to engage directly with real-world examples, allowing them to apply their learning in a tangible way. This hands-on approach can significantly reinforce the lesson's concepts and empower us to become more discerning consumers of information.<br><br> -Eugene Icban

                    <p>What I have learned on Sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar's teachings from lesson 3.5. I've learned that learning about different media types involves understanding various ways information is shared. This lesson covers things like newspapers, TV, radio, websites, and social media. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. By knowing these differences, we students can better understand and judge the information they come across, helping us become smarter consumers in today's media-filled world. Alongside recognizing different media types, this lesson might also delve into how each type influences the way information is presented and received. It could explore how traditional media might have editorial oversight, while social media often allows for user-generated content, impacting credibility and reliability. Understanding these nuances helps us students grasp how media types shape information, empowering them to make informed decisions about what to trust and how to engage with diverse sources of information. <br><br> -Eugene Icban
