                    <p>What i learned from lesson 5 from MIL that sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar discussed.Language is the primary means of communication and comprehension in a variety of settings, including the media. It functions as a technical and symbolic code. Symbolic codes are essential for communicating meaning to the audience through signs and symbols in the setting of media language. While the connotative meaning allows for a range of audience interpretations, the denotative meaning is the media text's literal interpretation. Understanding the pre-established meanings and structures inside a particular media product is necessary in order to interpret media texts correctly. This is where media codes and conventions come in. <br><br>

                        Narrative frameworks that help an audience understand the meaning of media communications are included in media language. The way a media text is understood as a whole depends on the usage of locations, mise en scene, acting, color, and other factors. The language of media is further enhanced by technical codes unique to each type of media, such as those pertaining to lighting, soundtrack, camerawork, and editing. A formal written language is also provided via written codes, such as speech bubbles, titles, captions, and headlines, in media products. Conventions provide the methods for applying these norms and support the organized interpretation of media content. They can range from form conventions to plot and genre conventions. <br><br>
                        
                        Producers in the media are the language architects; they use conventions and norms to craft messages for the target audience. Media content's meaning and narrative are shaped by the interaction of technical and symbolic codes as well as convention compliance. Deciphering these languages as media consumers enables us to interact with and evaluate the messages that media creators convey, emphasizing the complex interrelationship between language, communication, and the potent influence of media on our lives.<br><br>-Zion Canta
