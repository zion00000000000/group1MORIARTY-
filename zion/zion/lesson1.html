                    <p>hat i learned from lesson 5 from MIL that sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar discussed.Our first lesson is called “Introduction to Media and Information Literacy”, the topic introduce’s how media, information and technology should be used and how to become a responsible media and information literate. This lesson was discussed to us by our teacher Mr. Lee Mar Y. Sabugar, I’ve learned that being a media literate you need to know how to access, analyze, evaluate and create media. While becoming an information literate you need to recognize when information is needed, locate and evaluate. Throughout the duration of lesson 1 I was able to determine how to become a responsible media and information literate.<br><br>

                        I have realized that becoming anyone can become a media and information literate but one must be responsible in handling it. One must practice how to become literate at the same time become a responsible user. This practices have taught me to be a wise user of the internet and other media’s, and information must be spread wisely without harming others. This made me realize that any type of information i gathered should be shared at a respectful manner. Thus, One can become a media and information literate but everyone should become a responsible user<br><br>-Rohan Dongallo
