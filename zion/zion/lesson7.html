                    <p>What i learned from lesson 7 from MIL that sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar discussed. That there are opportunities and challenges in media, information and technology. The opportunities that might be experienced in media, information and technology is online shopping because you can buy goods online and it will be delivered to you. The challenges that might be experienced in media, information and technology is privacy invasion and identity theft in which they try to get your information to sell it or make the information of yourself be theirs. <br><br>

                        Furthermore, I learned in lesson 7 that there are laws against the abuse and misuse of media and information. This is republic act no. 10175 the cybercrime prevention act of 2012. In this law it covers all the anomalies online which are for example identity theft and data misuse. And also there are many other laws to in the media, information and technology, these are libel, slander, and piracy.<br><br>- James Jollado
