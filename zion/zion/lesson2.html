                    <p>After several months of having Sir Lee as my teacher in the subject of Media and Information Literacy (MIL), I can say that I have learned a lot, and my knowledge has been enhanced due to his teaching. I gained a clearer understanding of how machines and technology have evolved in our world. For example, "Papyrus" in the pre-industrial age. It was used by Egyptians and Greeks to document and record information before the existence of the paper we know today. As time goes by, people also become more intelligent. That's why they invented the big machine called "Printing press for mass production" capable of printing thousands of newspapers in a short period of time.<br><br>

                        Moreover, in the Electronic Age, they still use newspapers, as mentioned in the Industrial Age, but the machines used have become smaller, and the process of inputting written information has become easier. During this time, computers were invented, allowing for the quick recording and saving of written information. The last stage is the Information Age, also known as the Digital Age. This is our current era, where learning is considered easier because everything is on the internet or websites. Unlike before when some information could only be found in books, now, with just a click on a cellphone, computer, or laptop, the information we need quickly appears.<br><br>
                        
                        In summary, ancient tools are still in use today, but they have undergone changes. As time progresses, people accumulate knowledge and create new inventions not only for their benefit but also for others. Furthermore, with the evolution of machines and technology, communication and the transfer of information within the digital world have become easier and faster.<br><br><br>-Raymond Lautan
