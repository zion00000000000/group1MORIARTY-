                    <p>What I learned from lesson 4 in MIL that Sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar taught is about the media information sources. Media information sources, specifically, are about searching for information. These sources are where we get our news and information. They include newspapers, TV, online news sites, social media, and other platforms that share information with the public. There are three main sources of information: indigenous knowledge, libraries, and the modern tool to gather information on the internet. Indigenous knowledge pertains to the distinct customary knowledge systems and practices that are cultivated, amassed, and transmitted throughout successive generations within particular cultural and ethnic communities. A library is an intentionally chosen assortment of well-arranged information resources usually kept in a physical or virtual location, made available to the general public for reading, research, and borrowing. The internet is a global network of electronically connected computers and gadgets that facilitates communication and information sharing. Users can access a wide range of resources via it, such as web pages, online services, and multimedia files. <br><br>

                        Overall, we learned that the understanding of media information sources becomes evident when, for instance, we are seeking information about a current event. Suppose there is a news story circulating on social media regarding a local community issue. In this scenario, we can observe the use of both traditional and modern media information sources. We might first turn to a reputable online news site to get detailed and verified information about the event. Simultaneously, we could consult social media platforms to gauge public reactions and perspectives on the matter. Additionally, let's consider a situation where an individual is interested in learning about sustainable gardening practices. They may tap into indigenous knowledge by consulting elders or community members who possess traditional wisdom about eco-friendly farming methods. To complement this, they might visit a local library to borrow books and resources on sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, the internet can serve as a valuable tool for accessing online forums, articles, and videos that share contemporary insights into environmentally conscious gardening practices. <br><br>
