                    <p>What I learned from Sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar in lesson 6. Intellectual property is the creation of the mind such as inventions as a respect for their own work it is protected by IP LAW which means to avoid copying the original work. COPYRIGHT LAW is the control of access to one's own work if it is proven that it is only copyright, there is a large penalty for violating the rights of the owner. I learned that you shouldn't copy the work of others and you shouldn't always be on the computer because it has a bad effect, it will make it difficult for you to socialize with other people, and because the internet is so wide, many people abuse it, they use it as if they are abusing people even if they are not Physical abuse also affects a person's mental health. Cyberbullying is not a good thing. For example, posting a bad picture of a person and making it funny and saying hurtful words in the text. this lesson helped me a lot, I learned what to do and what not to do in the media and how to use the internet correctly. <BR></BR>-Cris Delos Reyes
